# Deployment and getting started with Github

On Day 6 of Our **WebDevBootcamp** we discuss about how you can deploy your website and we also discuss about the basics of **Git** and **Github** and how to use it.

## Resources

* Here's the link from where  you can download [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for windows.

* And if you want to know more about git be sure to check out their [docs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ao8XF9ybvgP8UilnDPdzEwiXTCiqIUtB/view?usp=sharing).

* But if you want to just get done with your project and look at the docs at some other time be sure to checkout this [README.md](https://github.com/DataCrusade1999/demo).

* Here's the [link]() to the deployed website.
